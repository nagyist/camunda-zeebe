        instructions: |
          This server exposes APIs of a Camunda 8 Orchestration Cluster. All operations are
          scoped to the permissions of the authenticated user.

          Most tools return eventually consistent data. Recently written data may not appear
          immediately in subsequent reads.

          Process instances, incidents, and user tasks are related. A process instance can have
          active incidents and user tasks. Use the process instance key to correlate across
          domains. To understand the structure of a process, retrieve its BPMN XML.

          When starting a process instance with awaitCompletion, a timeout does NOT mean the
          process failed — the instance was created and continues running. Tag each instance
          (e.g. "mcp-tool:<operation>-<timestamp>") so you can find it later. Poll the instance
          state: if COMPLETED, retrieve result variables; if it has an incident, investigate
          using the process instance key. Variables can be retrieved at any time, including
          while the instance is still running.
