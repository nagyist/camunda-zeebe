/**
 * Represents an agent that can trigger events and commands within the system.
 *
 * <p>This interface is used to trace events and commands that were issued directly or indirectly
 * through agentic interactions. It enables capturing the complete trail of changes that occurred as
 * a result of an agent's actions, providing full traceability of which agent (process) triggered
 * all subsequent changes in the system.
 *
 * <p>By associating an {@code Agent} with records, the system can:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Track the origin of events and commands back to the initiating agent
 *   <li>Build a complete audit trail of all changes triggered by an agent
 *   <li>Understand the causal chain of events resulting from agentic interactions
 *   <li>Enable debugging and analysis of agent-driven workflows
 * </ul>
